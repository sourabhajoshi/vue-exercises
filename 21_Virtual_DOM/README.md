# Virtual DOM in Vue3

- **Initial Render:** Vue generates a Virtual DOM based on your componentâ€™s template and data. This is a fast, in-memory object.

- **Data Change:** When the data changes (e.g., due to a user interaction), it triggers an update in the component.

- **Virtual DOM Update:** Vue generates a new Virtual DOM with the updated data.

- **Diffing:** Vue compares the previous Virtual DOM with the new one to determine what changed.

- **Real DOM Update**: Vue updates only the parts of the real DOM that have changed, improving efficiency.

- **Efficiency:** Vue avoids unnecessary re-renders and only updates the parts of the DOM that have changed, making the app faster and more responsive.
